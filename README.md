# Dota2-KMeans-Items
A project I did for Uni, just scrapes OpenDota, collects the top players, then collects their pro matches, then gets their item purchases. Using this we can filter and figure out what they buy. I'm aware that TP scrolls are included, and should be removed. So you should do that if you plan to use it.
